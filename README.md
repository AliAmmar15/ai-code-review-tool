# BugBusters - AI-Powered Code Review Tool

## Project Description

### Project Name
**BugBusters**

### Team Name
**OptiCode**

### Team Members
**Ali Ammar**

### Overview
The AI-Powered Code Review Tool is a Java-based software designed to help developers analyze and improve their Java code. It will detect bugs, inefficiencies, and violations of best practices while providing structured feedback to enhance code quality.

### Why This Project?
Manual code review is time-consuming and prone to human oversight. By automating the process, this tool will help students, developers, and educators quickly identify issues and optimize their Java code, improving software quality and learning efficiency.

### Key Features
- **Automated Java Code Analysis** – Detect syntax errors, inefficiencies, and bad practices.
- **Structured Feedback** – Provide suggestions for improving code quality.
- **Web-Based Interface** – Users can submit their code through a React.js frontend.
- **Spring Boot Backend** – Processes code and delivers analysis results.
- **Database Storage** – Save analysis history using PostgreSQL/MySQL.
- **GitHub Integration (Optional)** – Automate code reviews for pull requests.

### Use Cases
- **Students** – Improve coding assignments and learn best practices.
- **Developers** – Perform quick self-reviews before deployment.
- **Educators** – Provide automated feedback on student submissions.

## Technologies & Development Plan

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js (for a responsive web interface)
- **Backend:** Spring Boot (handles API requests and logic)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL/MySQL (stores code submissions and feedback)
- **Analysis Engine:** Rule-based Java logic, OpenAI API (optional for AI-powered analysis)
- **Hosting:** AWS, Firebase, or Google Cloud

### Project Timeline
- **Week 1-2:** Set up backend (Spring Boot), define APIs, and integrate database.
- **Week 3:** Develop frontend (React.js) and connect to backend.
- **Week 4:** Implement code analysis logic for detecting errors and best practices.
- **Week 5:** Add GitHub integration, finalize testing, fix bugs, and deploy.

## Estimated Effort & Challenges

### Backend Development
- ~12 hours (API design, data handling, authentication)

### Frontend Development
- ~8 hours (React.js UI and API integration)

### Analysis Engine
- ~15 hours (Java rule-based logic and optimizations)

### Testing & Refinement
- ~8 hours (Bug fixes, performance improvements)

### Total Estimated Effort
- ~43 hours

### Potential Challenges
- Ensuring accurate detection of Java code errors.
- Optimizing performance for analyzing large code files.
- Providing clear and helpful suggestions for improvement.

## Conclusion
This project aligns with object-oriented programming concepts, UML design, and software engineering best practices. The AI-powered tool will serve as a valuable educational and professional resource, helping developers improve their code efficiently. The structured development plan ensures timely completion, and additional features like GitHub integration will enhance its usability.
